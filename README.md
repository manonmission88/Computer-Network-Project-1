Please read below to find all the final works.

## Code
This folder contains the python3 script used for the project.
### Prem
* topology.py

## Data
This folder contains the traceroute Data collected from Howard University.
### Prem
* 10.127 (folder for 10.127 prefix)
* 10.26 (folder for 10.26 prefix)
* 138.238 (folder for 138.238 prefix)
* Subnets (folder for prefix - 10.1 / 10.3 / 10.7 / 10.8 / 10.99 / 10.24

### Pradeep
* ChemSubnet116 (folder for 10.116 prefix)
* 10.29.txt (folder for 10.29 prefix)
* 10.53.txt (folder for 10.53 prefix)
* UglSubnet199(folder for 10.199 prefix)

## Topology
### Prem
* all
* old
* seeds
* Final - This folder is for final topology. This folder contains the all.txt file which contains all the data collected. Because of its large size, it has not been included here. But, the routes.txt which is created by all_active_ips.py script by reading the all.txt file is contained within this folder.
